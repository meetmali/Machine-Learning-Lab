This is my Pre-final year subject. The data structure programs which I would be practising in python has been documented in this Repo.

| Exp no.   | LIST OF EXPERIMENT |
| :-------- | :-------- |
| 1         | `Linear Regression with single variable`   |
| 2         | `Linear Regression with multiple variable`   |
| 3         | `Logistic Regression`   |
| 4         | `Decision tree as classifier`   |
| 5         | `Implement decision tree as regression`   |
| 6         | `Naive bayes algorithm`   |
| 7         | `KNN classification`   |
| 8         | `SVM SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE`   |
| 9         | `K MEANS CLUSTERING`   |
| 10        | `PCA PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS`   |
| 11        | `CASE STUDY OF ANY ML APPLICATION PROBLEM SOL DATA SET KAHA SE LIVA DATA SET EXPLAIN ROW COLUM FEATURES PATTERN`  |


In the Exam there won't be internet connection.
