This is my Pre-final year subject. The data structure programs which I would be practising in python has been documented in this Repo.

| Exp no.   | LIST OF EXPERIMENT |
| :-------- | :-------- |
| 1         | `Linear Regression with single variable`   |
| 2         | `Linear Regression with multiple variable`   |
| 3         | `Logistic Regression`   |
| 4         | `WAP to implement Kruskal Algorithm for Minimum Cost Spanning Tree`   |
| 5         | `WWAP to implement Fractional Knapsack Problem using Greedy Approacht`   |
| 6         | `WAP to implement 0/1 Knapsack using Dynamic Programming`   |
| 7         | `WAP to implement Dijktstra Algorithm for Single source shortest path`   |
| 8         | `WAP to implement All Pair Shortest Path using Dynamic Programming`   |
| 9         | `WAP to implement DFS and BFS traversal in graphs`   |
| 10        | `WAP to implement 0/1 Knapsack using Dynamic Programming`   |
| 11        | `WAP to implement Sum of Subset Problem using Backtracking`   |
| 12        | `WAP to implement N-Queen Problem using Backtracking`   |

In the Exam there won't be internet connection.
